This is the SDO/EVE Solarsoft Codebase. With it, you can retrieve and perform analysis on the SDO/EVE spectrum and lines data.
<br/><br/> 
Of course you are welcome to use and examine this code in any way you wish. However, you are probably most interested in the 
category 'user routines'. In particular, the most useful and requested user routines are listed below:
<br/><br/>
<ul>
<li><a href="./eve_get_data.html" target="main_frame">eve_get_data.pro</a> - Get EVE data products across the Internet from the SDO/EVE data server</li> 
<li><a href="./eve_read_whole_fits.html" target="main_frame">eve_read_whole_fits.pro</a> - Read a single named FITS file, return as an IDL structure of structures with one field for each HDU</li> 
<li><a href="./eve_merge_evs.html" target="main_frame">eve_merge_evs.pro</a> - Merge several days' worth of EVE Level 2 spectra data files into a single array, with optional time-averaging</li> 
<li><a href="./eve_merge_evs.html" target="main_frame">eve_merge_evs.pro</a> - Merge several days' worth of EVE Level 2 lines data files into a single array, with optional time-averaging</li> 
<li><a href="./eve_process_spectrum.html" target="main_frame">eve_process_spectrum.pro</a> - Run one of your own functions against an array of EVE spectra</li> 
<li><a href="./stan_bands.html" target="main_frame">stan_bands.pro</a> - Calculate the "Stan bands" from an EVE spectrum</li> 
</ul>

Quick Start:<br>
Unpack this file into your ssw folder, where it will create a tree under sdo/eve. Open sswidl, and run the following commands:<br>
<code>
eve_get_data,2,2012001,2012001 ;Get all the EVE level 2 data from 2012/001 Jan 01
stan_spwx_hhmm,2012001         ;Run the example code to generate a Stan Bands space weather 
                               ;report for 2012/001 Jan 01 in file megs_stan_bands_2012001.txt in your current folder 
</code>
